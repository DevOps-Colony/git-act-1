# GitHub Actions Deployment Demo :

This project demonstrates how to set up a simple GitHub Actions workflow to deploy a static website to GitHub Pages.

## Project Goal

The main goal is to automatically deploy the `index.html` file to GitHub Pages whenever it's changed on the `main` branch. The `index.html` page has been styled to be modern and responsive.

## Project Page URL

You can view the live deployed website here:
**[https://devops-colony.github.io/git-act-1/](https://devops-colony.github.io/git-act-1/)**

## How to use this repository

1.  Fork this repository (`git-act-1`).
2.  Make a change to the `index.html` file in your forked repository.
3.  Push the change to the `main` branch.
4.  The GitHub Actions workflow will be triggered automatically.
5.  Once the workflow is complete, your website will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/git-act-1/`.
